The traditional version in use sounds like this:
O dear, what can the matter be?
Dear, dear, what can the matter be?
O dear, what can the matter be?
Johnny’s so long at the fair.
He promised he’d buy me a fairing should please me,
And then for a kiss, oh! he vowed he would tease me,
He promised he’d bring me a bunch of blue ribbons,
To tie up my bonny brown hair.
The first recorded version according to Oxford Dictionary of Nursery Rhymes by Iona and Peter Opie sounds like this:
O what can the matter be
And what can the matter be
O what can the matter be
Johnny bydes lang at the fair
He’ll buy me a twopenny whistle
He’ll buy me a threepenny fair
He’ll buy me a Bunch o’ Blue Ribbons
To tye up my bonny Brown Hair
O saw ye him coming
And saw ye him coming
O saw ye him coming
Hame frae the Newcastle fair.
