“The itsy bitsy spider crawled up the water spout.
Down came the rain, and washed the spider out.
Out came the sun, and dried up all the rain,
and the itsy bitsy spider went up the spout again”
In other versions, “crawled” is replaced with “climbed” or” went”
Incy Wincy spider climbing up the spout.
Down came the rain, and washed poor Incy out.
Up came the sun, and dried up all the rain
And Incy Wincy spider went climbing up again.
