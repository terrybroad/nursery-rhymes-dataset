Refrain
Jingle bells, Batman smells
Robin laid an egg
Batmobile lost a wheel
And Joker got away
Dashing through the snow
In a one-horse sloping sleigh
Jokerâ€™s on the go,
laughing all the way
The bells on Penguins ring
Make Riddler wanna fight
Two-Face wants to flip a coin
And sing this song tonight
Refrain
Jingle bells, Batman smells
Robin laid an egg
Batmobile lost a wheel
And Joker got away
