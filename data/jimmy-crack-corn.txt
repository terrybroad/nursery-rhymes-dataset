Jimmy crack corn, and I don’t care,
Jimmy crack corn, and I don’t care,
Jimmy crack corn, and I don’t care,
My master’s gone away.
The second verse goes:
He told me to plow, and I told him “No.”
He told me to sing, and I told him “No.”
He told me to play the old banjo,
And I called for rain and the winds did blow.
The third verse goes:
One day he rode around the farm,
The flies so numerous they did swarm,
One chanced to bite him on the thigh,
The devil take the blue-tail fly.
