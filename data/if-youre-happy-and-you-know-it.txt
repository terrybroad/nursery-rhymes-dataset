The first verses of the lyrics are usually:
If you’re happy and you know it, clap your hands
(clap clap)
If you’re happy and you know it, clap your hands
(clap clap)
If you’re happy and you know it, then your face will surely show it
If you’re happy and you know it, clap your hands.
(clap clap)
The “clap your hands” part is then switched with other phrases like:
snap your fingers!
pat your head!
shout Hooray!
nod your head!
turn around!
slap your knees!
etc
