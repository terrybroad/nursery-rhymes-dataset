The words of the song can be changed easily and there are many variations circulating. Sometimes “it was rotten” is changed with “it was mouldy”, and “ate it anyway” is changed by “still ate it” but most of these variations do not change the meaning of the lyrics.
Some prefer to sing a longer version of Found a Peanut in which they substitute “Operation” by “Cut me open” then add a few more verses like “Took the peanut out”, “Sewed me up again”, “Left the scissors in”, “Cut me open again”, “Took some medicine”.
