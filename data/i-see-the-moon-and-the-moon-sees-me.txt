This version is derived from one recorded by Clifton Johnson in “What They Say in New England: A Book of Signs, Sayings, and Superstitions” from 1896.
Today it goes like this:
I see the moon and the moon sees me,
The moon sees somebody I wanna see
God bless the moon and God bless me:
And God bless that somebody I wanna see.
Printed by Joyce in “Old Irish Folk Music and Songs” 1909
I see the moon, the moon sees me,
God bless the moon and God bless me:
There’s grace in the cottage and grace in the hall;
And the grace of God is over us all.
by Meredith Willson
Chorus
Over the mountain, over the sea,
Back where my heart is longing to be,
Please let the light that shines on me
Shine on the one I love.
I see the moon; the moon sees me
Down through the leaves of the old oak tree.
Please let the light that shines on me
Shine on the one I love.
I hear the lark; the lark hears me,
Singing a song with a melody.
Please let the lark that sings for me
Sing for the one I love.
I kiss a rose; the rose kisses me,
Fragrant as only a rose can be.
Please let the Rose that comforts me
Comfort the one I love.
