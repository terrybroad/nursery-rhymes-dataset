It rose to popularity during the 1940s when it was recorded simultaneously in the UK by Jimmy Kennedy (The Hokey Cokey) in 1942 and in the United States by Robert Degan and Joe Brier (The Hokey Pokey Dance).</p>\n<p>The song was also recorded by the Ram Trio in 1950 and by Ray Anthony’s orchestra in 1953, a version that charted in the USA.</p>\n<p>The origins of the song can be traced back to the 19th century, it was first mentioned in Robert Chamber’s “Popular Rhymes of Scotland” in 1826. That version was very different from the contemporary one:</p>\n<p>Fal de ral la, fal de ral la:<br>\nHinkumbooby, round about;<br>\nRight hands in, and left hands out,<br>\nHinkumbooby, round about;<br>\nFal de ral la, fal de ral la<br>\nIn 1872 a version called “Ugly Mug” was published:<br>\nI put my right hand in<br>\nI put my right hand out<br>\nI give my right hand, shake, shake, shake, and turn myself about</p>\n<p>The song and dance moves vary between the United States and the United Kingdom. The UK version is slightly more popular wordlwide.</p>\n<h2>Dance Moves</h2>\n<p>In the first four verses the body part is moved according to the lyrics. On “You do the Hokey Cokey” each player joins their hands and rocks them side to side. On “And you turn around” players turn around clockwise with the hands still joined together.</p>\n<p>During the chorus, during each “Whoa” that lasts three beats, players raise their joined hands and move towards the centre of the circle and on “the hokey cokey” or often “the hokey cokey cokey” they move outwards to their original positions.</p>\n<p>On the last two verses, players will bend their knees and raise their arms then on “rah rah rah” they will raise their hands and clap them. In some areas, players will run towards the centre with their hands up.</p>\n<h3>Is it Hokey Cokey or Hokey Pokey?</h3>\n<p>Generally in the United Kingdom or Jamaica, the song is called Hokey Cokey and in the USA, Canada and Australia it is called Hokey Pokey. The first modern version of the song from 1942 by Jimmy Kennedy was called “The Cokey Cokey” while the first modern US version from 1944 was called “The Hokey Pokey”.</p>\n<h3>Why is it Called Hokey Cokey?</h3>\n<p>There are no certainties regarding the meaning of “Hokey Cokey” but supposedly the name of the song is derived from the magician’s incantation “Hocus Pocus”</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">“Hokey Cokey” Lyrics</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">You put your left arm in,<br>\nYour left arm out:<br>\nIn, out, in, out.<br>\nYou shake it all about.<br>\nYou do the hokey cokey,<br>\nAnd you turn around.<br>\nThat’s what it’s all about!</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Chorus:</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Whoa, the hokey cokey<br>\nWhoa, the hokey cokey<br>\nWhoa, the hokey cokey<br>\nKnees bend, arms stretch,<br>\nRah, rah, rah!</p>\n<p>The “left hand” is changed in subsequent stanzas with “right arm”, “left leg”, “right leg”, “whole self” or any other body part including “left hip”, “right hip”, “left elbow”, “right elbow” etc.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">USA version</h2>\n<p>Both the song and the dance instructions differ slightly in the USA. While the first part of the song is similar, the chorus is different:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">You do the hokey pokey,<br>\nThe hokey pokey,<br>\nThe hokey pokey.<br>\nThat’s what it’s all about!</p>\n<p>On each “pokey”, the players raise their arms with the index fingers pointed up, shaking their arms up and down and their hips side to side.</p>\n</div>"},

Like <a href=\"https://allnurseryrhymes.com/the-muffin-man/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"367\">The Muffin Man</a> and other old nursery rhymes, traditional songs were passed on not only oral but also as part of a singing game.</p>\n<p>“Oranges and Lemons” lyrics were first published around 1744 in Tommy Thumb’s “Pretty Song Book” collection.</p>\n<p>Although the exact origins of it is still uncertain, back in time, in the 17th century a similar singing game existed also named as Oranges and Lemon. References about this square dance were found in the 3rd edition (1665) of a dancing manual published by John Playford in the 1660’s, “The English Dancing Master”. However there isn’t much proved connection of the game with the “Oranges and Lemons” nursery rhyme.</p>\n<p>The church names mentioned in the nursery rhyme are also a subject of many discussions as their name varies throughout version. However the song’s tune actually has its origin in the sound of church bells and more than that, today, the sound of the bells at St. Clement Danes in City of Westminster, London, imitates the tune of Oranges and Lemons. Most commonly the name of the churches in this rhyme are related to some churches around London although similar songs can be found in different regions in England, naming various churches.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span style=\"color: #00afaf;\">“Oranges and Lemons” as a game</span></h2>\n<p>“Oranges and lemons” is also a very popular singing game, having similar rules with “<a href=\"https://allnurseryrhymes.com/london-bridge-is-falling-down/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"224\">London Bridge is falling down</a>”.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How to play:</h3>\n<p>At the beginning 2 kids, face to face are joining their hands, forming an arch. One of them will represent The Oranges and one of them The Lemons. This must be agreed from the beginning</p>\n<p>The rest of them one by one, will form a line, by catching the dress of the kid that stays in front of them. All of them will start to run through the arch (under the hand of the first 2 players) singing the lyrics of Oranges and Lemons.</p>\n<p>When the word “head” is pronounced, the arch will drop the arms down and the kid who’ll be in the arch will be catched. They will ask him very quietly: Oranges or Lemons? The answer must be also said very quietly so that the other players cannot hear it. He or she will then have to sit in the back of the representative that he chose by answering, holding him around his waist.</p>\n<p>The game continues until each child is captured and now there are two teams formed. The kids from each team must hold each other’s middle strongly, forming a tug. Between the teams there is a line singed in the middle. The two kids, now each carrying his team in the back will start the oranges and lemons war: they have to pull strongly until one of them will succeed to cross the line that divides them, moving forward the entire team with them.</p>\n<h2 class=\"has-text-align-center wp-block-heading\"><span style=\"color: #00afaf;\">“Oranges and Lemons” Lyrics</span></h2>\n<h3 class=\"has-text-align-center wp-block-heading\">Modern version</h3>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><span style=\"font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.4;\">Oranges and lemons,</span></p>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">Say the bells of St. Clement’s.</p>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">You owe me five farthings,<br>Say the bells of St. Martin’s.</p>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">When will you pay me?<br>Say the bells of Old Bailey.</p>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">When I grow rich,<br>Say the bells of Shoreditch.</p>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">When will that be?<br>Say the bells of Stepney.</p>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">I do not know,<br>Says the great bell of Bow.</p>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">Here comes a candle to light you to bed,<br>And here comes a chopper to chop off your head!</p>\n<h3 class=\"has-text-align-center wp-block-heading\"><span style=\"color: #00afaf;\">“Oranges and Lemons” Original lyrics</span></h3>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">Two Sticks and Apple,<br>Ring ye Bells at Whitechapple,<br>Old Father Bald Pate,<br>Ring ye Bells Aldgate,<br>Maids in White Aprons,<br>Ring ye Bells a St. Catherines,<br>Oranges and Lemmons,<br>Ring ye bells at St. Clemens,<br>When will you pay me,<br>Ring ye Bells at ye Old Bailey,<br>When I am Rich,<br>Ring ye Bells at Fleetditch,<br>When will that be,<br>Ring ye Bells at Stepney,<br>When I am Old,<br>Ring ye Bells at Pauls</p>\n</div>"},

Much like other nursery rhymes, this gruesome option uses a fun melody to create a song which helps to take the emphasis off the deeper meaning of the rhyme.</p>\n<p>During World War I, The Hearse Song was sung by both British and American soldiers but there are suggestions that soldiers in the Crimean War in the 19th century also sang the same song as they moved their casualties and forged ahead to try and win each battle.</p>\n<h2 class=\"has-text-align-center wp-block-heading\">The Worms Crawl In The Worms Crawl Out (The Hearse Song) Lyrics</h2>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">… Don’t ever laugh as a Hearse goes by<br>For you may be the next to die<br>They wrap you up in a big white sheet<br>From your head down to your feet<br>… They put you in a big black box<br>And cover you up with dirt and rocks<br>And all goes well for about a week<br>And then your coffin begins to leak<br>… And the worms crawl in, the worms crawl out<br>The worms play pinochle on your snout<br>They eat your eyes, they eat your noes<br>They eat the jelly between your toes<br>… A big green worm with rolling eyes<br>Crawls in your stomach and out your eyes<br>Your stomach turns a slimy green<br>And puss comes out like whipping cream<br>… You spread it on a slice of bread<br>And that’s what you eat when your dead<br>And the worms crawl out and the worms crawl in<br>The worms that crawl in are lean and thin<br>… The ones that crawl out are fat and stout<br>Your eyes fall in and your hair falls out<br>Your brain comes tumbling down your snout<br>… And the worms crawl in, the worms crawl out<br>They crawl all over your dirty snout<br>Your chest caves in and your eyes pop out<br>And your brain turns to sauerkraut<br>… They invite their friends, and their friends too<br>They all come down to chew on you<br>And this is what it is to die<br>I hope you had a nice goodbye<br>… Did you ever think as a Hearse goes by<br>That you may be the next to die<br>And your eyes fall out and your teeth decay<br>And that is the end of a perfect… day</p>\n</div>"},

Everyone who plays (should be an odd number) must form couples and then the couples form a circle, or a square dance. The person who remains unaccompanied goes in the middle.</p>\n<p>While singing or listening to the song the couples will skip hand in hand around in a ring. After the verse “Lost my partner, what’ll I do?” the middle person will choose a partner from the existing couples, when they have their hands free, saying “I’ll get another one just like you” or “better than you”. If they cannot catch one they will try for another round. The person left without a partner will continue the game in the same manner.

Although the first written records of the song date back to the mid 19th century, it is believed that the origins of the song go back to the 18th century England.</p>\n<h3>Meaning</h3>\n<p>There are many known versions of Pop Goes the Weasel. Currently there are two different popular versions in use in the UK and in the USA. The original version of the song (published in the 1850’s) is featured below:</p>\n<p><em>Up and down the City Road</em><br>\n<em> In and out the Eagle</em><br>\n<em> That’s the way the money goes</em><br>\n<em> Pop! goes the weasel.</em></p>\n<p>There is much debate regarding the meaning of this rhyme. It is widely believed that the Eagle mentioned in the song refers to the Eagle Tavern near the City Road in North London. Thus, it is easy to assume that originally, the song refers to drinking at the Eagle Tavern. However, there are plenty of theories about the meaning of the last verse, which gives the song’s title as well.</p>\n<p>It is possible that pop refers to pawns, and thus the lyrics would mean to drink until there’s no money left so people pawn their suits to grab more money (weasel may mean suit in the slang of Cockney, a slang that often used rhymes as a speech form).</p>\n<p>Another supposition is that the weasel refers to the small mammal predator named weasel, and they indeed pop their heads when bothered.</p>\n<p>Whatever the original meaning of the song was, when it became popular in the USA in the 1850’s, the phrase “Pop Goes the Weasel” was used as “just like that”.</p>\n<p>The dance was very popular in England too; there are two references that Queen Victoria used to play it at the balls organized by the Court.</p>\n<p>Even today, there are plenty of variations of the lyrics. Below, you will find the two most popular versions of them. First, the version more popular in the UK.

The character was related to some legendary names in British History, all identified as King Coel and mostly mentioned in British legends and literature.</p>\n<p>One of those figures was Coel Hen, also nicknamed, Coel the Old or Old King Cole because of his age.

He was canonized for this practice later on.</p>\n<p>Another interpretation of this song’s origins is that it could be a musical theme song. In Gaelic the term ceol means music.

It is also known as “Blue Tail Fly” or “The Blue-Tailed Fly” and has been popularized through various recordings and adaptations over the years. Cracking corn was an old idiom that meant sitting around gossiping. </p>\n<p>The song’s meaning is rooted in the experiences of enslaved people in the American South, who often used music and storytelling as a way to express their emotions and connect with each other.</p>\n<p>The song’s first verse suggests that the singer doesn’t care about their master’s absence, implying a sense of liberation and freedom. The second verse references the idea of resistance and refusal, with the singer pushing back against their master’s orders. The third verse tells a story about a blue-tailed fly biting the master, leading to his death, which can be seen as a form of poetic justice or retribution.</p>\n<p>Overall, “Jimmy Crack Corn” is a lively and spirited song that has endured over time as a testament to the creativity and resilience of African American culture.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Controversies</h3>\n<p>As with a song of this nature, Jimmy Crack Corn is bound to have controversies around it.

The song’s first verse, with its repeated line “Jimmy crack corn, and I don’t care,” has been criticized for presenting a false and overly simplistic picture of the experiences of enslaved people. Critics argue that the song reinforces harmful stereotypes.</p>\n<p>The song’s third verse, which tells the story of a blue-tailed fly biting the master and leading to his death, has also been controversial.

In the 16th century the words Jack and Jill were used to indicate a boy and a girl. This use was also found twice in some of Shakespeare’s plays, and also in a comedy act, “Jack and Jill” performed around 1567-8 at the Elizabethan court. “A good Jack makes a good Jill” is an old English proverb having the same meaning.</p>\n<p>However, the rhyme was first known as Jack and Gill, referring to two boys, not a boy and a girl. It was first recorded in 1765, and published later on in the Mother Goose’s Melody, as John Newbery’s song.</p>\n<p>The rhyme has been modified several times over the years, with additional lyrics being added. Bellow is the most common version of the modern song:</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #00afaf;\">“Jack and Jill” Lyrics</span></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Jack and Jill went up the hill<br>\nTo fetch a pail of water.<br>\nJack fell down and broke his crown,<br>\nAnd Jill came tumbling after.<br>\nThen up got Jack and said to Jill,<br>\nAs in his arms he took her,<br>\n“Brush off that dirt for you’re not hurt,<br>\nLet’s fetch that pail of water.”<br>\nSo Jack and Jill went up the hill<br>\nTo fetch the pail of water,<br>\nAnd took it home to Mother dear,<br>\nWho thanked her son and daughter.</p>\n</div>"},

However, it is difficult to state the exact origin of its lyrics, but it can be connected with the London Bridge’s history, one of the most well-known bridges in London, today also a very popular tourist destination.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">London Bridge Short History</h2>\n<p>Originally a wooden bridge, London Bridge’s history dates back to the Roman occupation era, just around AD50. It was destroyed several times and rebuilt during the Viking and Saxon invasions but also during natural disasters such as the 1091 tornado or the great fire of 1135.</p>\n<p>The construction of the first Medieval London Bridge was started in 1176 and continued for 33 years, under Peter de Colechurch’s instructions. The new stone bridge, completed in 1209, was designed with 19 arches and a gatehouse accessed by a drawbridge. It was populated with around 200 shops and businesses, so crossing the river became really hard. The bridge’s endurance was also put in danger by carrying such a heavy charge on it.</p>\n<p>The shops above it, among others, affected London Bridge’s strength. Although the bridge was not destroyed in the 1666 fire, its stability was seriously deteriorated.</p>\n<p>A new construction of London Bridge was started in the 19th century, replacing the old one, demolished in 1831. The actual London Bridge is an even more recent edifice, started during the 1960s. The demolished bridge in 1831 was sold out, and stone by stone it was moved and re-assembled in a new place in Lake Havasu, Arizona.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">“London Bridge Is Falling Down” As a Game</h2>\n<p>London Bridge was indeed “falling down” several times over the years, being re-built stronger again and again. The song has become one of the most popular singing-games among kids over the world, being translated and adapted in many languages, especially in European countries such as Denmark: “Knippelsbro Gar Op og Ned”, France: “Pont chus”, Italy “Le porte” Germany: “Die Magdeburger Bruck” and Romania “Podul de piatra”.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How to play:</h3>\n<p>Two kids are making an arch holding their hands up, face to face and the rest of them, are passing under the arch, one by one, creating a circle. They continue to walk under the arch, one by one in circle. When the last word of the verse is said (the “My fair Lady”) the two children who form the arch have to capture one child by dropping their hands down. The game continues until each kid is captured.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><a href=\"https://allnurseryrhymes.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/london-bridge-is-falling-down-sheet.png\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"632\" height=\"59\" src=\"https://allnurseryrhymes.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/london-bridge-is-falling-down-sheet.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2230\" srcset=\"https://allnurseryrhymes.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/london-bridge-is-falling-down-sheet.png 632w, https://allnurseryrhymes.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/london-bridge-is-falling-down-sheet-300x28.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px\"></a><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>London Bridge is falling down – music sheet </em></figcaption></figure>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><a href=\"https://allnurseryrhymes.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/london-bridge-is-falling-down-lyrics-and-sheet.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"700\" height=\"706\" src=\"https://allnurseryrhymes.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/london-bridge-is-falling-down-lyrics-and-sheet.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2231\" srcset=\"https://allnurseryrhymes.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/london-bridge-is-falling-down-lyrics-and-sheet.jpg 700w, https://allnurseryrhymes.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/london-bridge-is-falling-down-lyrics-and-sheet-297x300.jpg 297w, https://allnurseryrhymes.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/london-bridge-is-falling-down-lyrics-and-sheet-150x150.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\"></a><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>London Bridge is falling down lyrics and music sheet </em></figcaption></figure>\n<h2 class=\"has-text-align-center wp-block-heading\">“London Bridge Is Falling Down” Lyrics</h2>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">London Bridge is falling down,<br>Falling down, falling down,<br>London Bridge is falling down,<br>My fair Lady.</p>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">Build it up with wood and clay,<br>Wood and clay, wood and clay,<br>Build it up with wood and clay,<br>My fair Lady.</p>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">Wood and clay will wash away,<br>Wash away, wash away,<br>Wood and clay will wash away,<br>My fair Lady.</p>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">Build it up with bricks and mortar,<br>Bricks and mortar, bricks and mortar,<br>Build it up with bricks and mortar,<br>My fair Lady.</p>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">Bricks and mortar will not stay,<br>Will not stay, will not stay,<br>Bricks and mortar will not stay,<br>My fair Lady.</p>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">Build it up with iron and steel,<br>Iron and steel, iron and steel,<br>Build it up with iron and steel,<br>My fair Lady.</p>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">Iron and steel will bend and bow,<br>Bend and bow, bend and bow,<br>Iron and steel will bend and bow,<br>My fair Lady.</p>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">Build it up with silver and gold,<br>Silver and gold, silver and gold,<br>Build it up with silver and gold,<br>My fair Lady.</p>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">Silver and gold will be stolen away,<br>Stolen away, stolen away,<br>Silver and gold will be stolen away,<br>My fair Lady.</p>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">Set a man to watch all nigh,<br>Watch all night, watch all night,<br>Set a man to watch all night,<br>My fair Lady.</p>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">Suppose the man should fall asleep,<br>Fall asleep, fall asleep,<br>Suppose the man should fall asleep?<br>My fair Lady.</p>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">Give him a pipe to smoke all night,<br>Smoke all night, smoke all night,<br>Give him a pipe to smoke all night,<br>My fair Lady.</p>\n</div>"},
